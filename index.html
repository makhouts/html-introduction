  <h4>A funny story:</h4>
  <p class="funny-story">
      Once I went to a person who was selling a book, that I needed for school.
      Once arrived I sent a photo to the seller that I've arrived. She told me that I was in a wrong neighbourhood.
      I told her, but that's the address that you have sent me, she told me no that's not true. I went looking back to our conversation and indeed I was wrong.
  </p>
  <h5>Went to a wrong address, while thinking the seller tricked me.</h5>
